## üìù General

Goal of the project is to create `shell` which supports basic `bash` functionality.

These include file redirections, signal handling and pipes among others.

Also some of the basic `commands` such as `export` and `cd` and are supported as `buildins`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

GNU `make`, `gcc` and `readline` are required to build and compile the project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Shell was designed for `linux`. Extra steps might be required for MacOS and Windows. ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Jarnomer/minishell.git
```

```bash
cd minishell && make all
```

## ‚ö° Usage

```bash
make run
```

You can use the following `features` as you would in bash shell using the `terminal`.

| Feature               | Description                                                                             |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Quotes         | Prevents shell from interpreting meta-characters in quoted `'` sequences.               |
| Double Quotes         | Prevents shell from interpreting meta-characters in quoted `"` sequences, except `$`.   |
| Pipes                 | Connects command outputs and inputs using `\|` the pipeline.                            |
| Environment Variables | Expand to their values when `$` is followed by a sequence of characters.                |
| Exit Status           | Expand `$?` to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.       |

It also supports these `redirect` operators and `control` sequences.

| Operator    | Description                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `<`         | Redirects input.                 |
| `>`         | Redirects output.                |
| `<<`        | Reads heredoc till delimiter.    |
| `>>`        | Redirects output in append mode. |

| Signal      | Description                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-C`    | Displays a new prompt on a new line. |
| `Ctrl-D`    | Exits the shell.                     |
| `Ctrl-\`    | Does nothing.                        |

Finally here is the list of featured buildin `commmands`.

| Command         | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `echo`          | Prints arguments to the standard output. Supports `-n` option to omit the trailing newline. |
| `cd`            | Changes the current directory to the specified relative or absolute path.                   |
| `pwd`           | Prints the current working directory. No options are supported.                             |
| `export`        | Sets environment variables. No options are supported.                                       |
| `unset`         | Unsets environment variables. No options are supported.                                     |
| `env`           | Displays the current environment variables. No options or arguments are supported.          |
| `exit`          | Exits the shell. No options are supported.                                                  |

## üöÄ Details

Once input is given by the user, it is splitted into `modules` based one the `pipeline`.

Each module is then parsed and devided into `command`, `infile` and `outfile` arguments.

Parser also checks if arguments should be expanded `$` or `joined` with previous argument.

After modules are prepared, file operations are processed where heredocs are given precedence.
